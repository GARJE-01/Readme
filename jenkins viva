Sure! Here are 30 basic viva questions for a DevOps lab, along with very short answers:

### General Concepts
1. *What is DevOps?*  
   A culture that combines development and operations to improve collaboration and productivity.

2. *What are the key principles of DevOps?*  
   Collaboration, automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery.

3. *What is CI/CD?*  
   Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery; practices that automate the software release process.

4. *What is version control?*  
   A system that tracks changes to code over time.

5. *Name a popular version control system.*  
   Git.

### Tools and Technologies
6. *What is Git?*  
   A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code.

7. *What is Docker?*  
   A platform that automates application deployment in lightweight containers.

8. *What is a container?*  
   A lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient unit for running applications.

9. *What is Kubernetes?*  
   An orchestration tool for managing containerized applications.

10. *What is Jenkins?*  
    An open-source automation server used for CI/CD.

### Processes and Practices
11. *What is infrastructure as code (IaC)?*  
    Managing infrastructure using code and automation rather than manual processes.

12. *What are microservices?*  
    An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.

13. *What is configuration management?*  
    Maintaining systems in a desired state using automation tools.

14. *What are the benefits of automated testing?*  
    Faster feedback, consistency, and reduced human error.

15. *What is a deployment pipeline?*  
    A series of automated steps to build, test, and deploy code.

### Monitoring and Security
16. *What is monitoring in DevOps?*  
    Tracking the performance and health of applications and infrastructure.

17. *What is a rollback?*  
    Reverting to a previous version of code due to issues in the current release.

18. *What is DevSecOps?*  
    Integrating security practices into the DevOps process.

19. *What are logs?*  
    Records of events or messages generated by applications and systems.

20. *What is a service level agreement (SLA)?*  
    A contract that defines expected service levels between service providers and clients.

### Cloud and Deployment
21. *What is cloud computing?*  
    Delivery of computing services over the internet.

22. *What is a virtual machine (VM)?*  
    An emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system.

23. *What is AWS?*  
    Amazon Web Services, a cloud computing platform.

24. *What is continuous delivery?*  
    Automatically preparing code changes for release to production.

25. *What is blue-green deployment?*  
    A deployment strategy that reduces downtime by switching between two identical environments.

### Miscellaneous
26. *What is a build?*  
    The process of converting source code into a runnable application.

27. *What is an artifact?*  
    A file produced during the build process, like binaries or packages.

28. *What is a load balancer?*  
    A device that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers.

29. *What is a commit in Git?*  
    A snapshot of changes made to the codebase.

30. *What is a branch in Git?*  
    A parallel version of the code repository used for development.

Sure! Here are some basic Jenkins viva questions with short answers:

### Basic Jenkins Questions

1. *What is Jenkins?*  
   An open-source automation server for continuous integration and continuous delivery.

2. *What is a Jenkinsfile?*  
   A text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins pipeline.

3. *What is a Jenkins job?*  
   A task or work item that Jenkins executes, such as building a project.

4. *What is a pipeline in Jenkins?*  
   A series of automated steps defined in code to build, test, and deploy applications.

5. *What are plugins in Jenkins?*  
   Extensions that add features and functionalities to Jenkins.

6. *What is the purpose of the Jenkins master?*  
   The master manages jobs and coordinates with agents to execute builds.

7. *How do you trigger a build in Jenkins?*  
   By using webhooks, scheduled triggers, or manual initiation.

8. *What is a build artifact?*  
   A file generated from a build process, such as binaries or packages.

9. *What is continuous integration?*  
   A practice of merging code changes frequently to detect errors quickly.

10. *How can you secure Jenkins?*  
    By configuring user authentication, authorization, and using HTTPS.
